## üìä What We Accomplished in This Medical Insurance Project

### **Problem Type**: Regression (Predicting continuous insurance charges)

### **Step 1: Data Exploration**
```python
# Loaded medical insurance dataset
# Examined features: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges
# Identified 'charges' as our target variable
```

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
```python
# Numerical Features:
# - Extracted: age, bmi, children
# - Applied StandardScaler for normalization

# Categorical Features:
# - Encoded: sex, smoker, region
# - Used appropriate encoding techniques

# Feature Combination:
inputs = np.concatenate((scaled_inputs, categorical_data), axis=1)
```

### **Step 3: Model Development**
```python
# Algorithm Choice: Linear Regression
# - Suitable for regression problems
# - Interpretable coefficients
# - Good baseline model

# Training Process:
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(train_inputs, train_targets)
```

### **Step 4: Model Evaluation**
```python
# Metrics Used: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
# Results:
# - Test Loss: 5796.28
# - Train Loss: 6105.54

# Performance Analysis:
# - Test loss < Train loss (unusual but positive sign)
# - Indicates good generalization
# - Model performs well on unseen data
```

### **Step 5: Feature Importance Analysis**
```python
# Analyzed model coefficients to understand feature impact
weights = pd.DataFrame(model.coef_, index=input_cols, columns=['weight'])
# This helps identify which features most influence insurance charges
```
