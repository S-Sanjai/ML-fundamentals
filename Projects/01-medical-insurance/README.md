# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction 🏥💰

A machine learning project that predicts medical insurance costs based on individual characteristics using Linear Regression.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict medical insurance charges based on demographic and health factors. The model achieves superior performance through effective data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Objective**: Predict medical insurance costs for individuals based on their personal characteristics.

**Problem Type**: Regression (predicting continuous numerical values)

**Target Variable**: Insurance charges (in USD)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about individuals and their medical insurance costs with the following features:

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `age` | Numerical | Age of the individual |
| `sex` | Categorical | Gender (male/female) |
| `bmi` | Numerical | Body Mass Index |
| `children` | Numerical | Number of children/dependents |
| `smoker` | Categorical | Smoking status (yes/no) |
| `region` | Categorical | Geographic region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest) |
| `charges` | Numerical | Medical insurance charges (target variable) |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Numerical Features**: Age, BMI, Children
   - Applied `StandardScaler` for normalization
   
2. **Categorical Features**: Sex, Smoker, Region
   - Encoded using appropriate encoding techniques
   
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   ```python
   inputs = np.concatenate((scaled_inputs, categorical_data), axis=1)
   ```

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 with `random_state=42`
- **Evaluation Metric**: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

## 📈 Performance Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Test RMSE** | 5,796.28 |
| **Train RMSE** | 6,105.54 |
| **Performance** | ✅ Superior generalization (test < train loss) |

### Key Achievement
The model demonstrates **excellent generalization** with test loss being lower than training loss, indicating robust performance on unseen data.
